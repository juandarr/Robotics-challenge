# Real Time Factor (RTF)
Real time factor is the ratio of simulation time to real time. The target **real time factor** in simulations is represented by the product of the **real time update rate** (number of iterations per second) and the **max step size** (time that takes to perform one iteration), thus the goal is to keep it in 1, so that we can perform different processes in the simulation at the expected rate and time. Keeping the RTF value at 1 means that the system is able to perform the number of expected iterations per second (real time update rate) at the expected max step size. If the system is not able to provide that (due for example to limitations in computing power or memory), the RTF will be less than 1.
